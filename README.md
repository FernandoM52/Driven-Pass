# Password Manager

Is a password manager that simplifies the task of creating, storing and accessing secure passwords. The approach is to allow users to create a single strong and secure "master" password. All other passwords, which are usually long and complex, are stored securely and encrypted within the application. This eliminates the need to memorize multiple complex passwords with no semantic meaning, which can be a challenging task.
